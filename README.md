Summary

In this study, I analysed the similarities & dissimilarities between the cities of a particular state. I identified the different categories of venues and sorted them. Then by means of graphical representation & k-means clustering, I categorized different cities into cluster groups. The model will help many stakeholders & business people to predict the profit for opening a particular business in a particular area or also, if they should open that particular business or not. People are turning to big cities to start a business or work. They can achieve better outcomes through their access to the platforms where such information is provided. And, not only for investors but also city managers can manage the city more regularly by using similar data analysis types or platforms.
